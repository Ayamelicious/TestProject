In a world where people are more likely to blame a certain breed of dog for their brutality rather than the way it is brought up, it is necessary for an app where dog owners can find other owners and set up dates with their dogs so that dogs can learn to socialize with others ensuring that dogs meeting another wont be a stressful occurence but an exciting and heart warming one. Ofcourse all this would only be possible for dogs that have a loving owner, what about those without a loving home yet? This app will also help owners find local dogs that match their personalities and preference leaving both dog and hooman happy. I Did it!
